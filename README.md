# GOG Galaxy 2.0 Shortcut Creator

Cause GOG Galaxy 2.0 won't let you create shortcuts of games in its library, here's a program to do it!

This program will show you currently installed games that are listed in GOG Galaxy 2.0, and then you can create a desktop shortcut for that program

It's useful because you'll let GOG Galaxy 2.0 manage the game and launcher!

KNOWN ISSUES:

- All rockstar games in your library will show as installed, even if they are not.
- ~~The icon will be GOG Galaxy icon. You gotta change it manually :(~~
- ~~If you click create shortcut without having selected a row, or double click the empty white space in the box, you'll get an error. Just click continue~~~
